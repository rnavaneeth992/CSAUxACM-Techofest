"Ram‚Ä¶.. Jaanu‚Ä¶"
Ram and Jaanu, once inseparable college mates at CEG, shared a special bond that time and life separated. 27 years later, Ram, now a renowned wildlife photographer, returns to the college for a reunion with former classmates. To his surprise, Jaanu is also attending the event, and the two reconnect after all these years. Amidst conversations with friends, Jaanu's life in Singapore comes up.

As they reminisce about their college days at CEG, discussing their past and catching up on life events, they feel the bittersweet emotions of reconnecting with a lost love. Jaanu, now happily married in Singapore, entrusts Ram to be married too. But still Ram hasn't forgotten her. He wishes to know about her life events after college. He knows Jaanu has kept her secrets in her account on the CEG website (https://csau-utopia.vercel.app). 

Ram, eager to unravel the mysteries of Jaanu's life, discovers her account holds the next chapter of their story. He remembers clearly that CEG‚Äôs college mail ID will start with her name followed by their graduation year. And surely he does know Jaanu account's password. During their college days, they decided to use a phrase that echoes Forever, encapsulating the timeless bond between two souls as a password. A combination of their names and an everlasting sentiment combined might reveal the key to Jaanu's account.

While reading through the diary found at Blue Shed, Ram finds out that Jaanu lived as Jessi in Singapore after college. The diary starts with the line: 

'Out of all the girls in the world, why did I Love Jessie' - Karthik

Karthik, an aspiring videographer, meets Jessie (Jaanu), while she is on a family vacation in Kerala. They start off on the wrong foot because she knew Karthik was her junior in College. But soon, Karthik and Jessie become friends and eventually fall in love. However, Jessie's family is opposed to their relationship, as they belong to different religions. When all their efforts prove to be futile, they decide to part ways. Years later, Karthik becomes a successful videographer and all his hard work & practice through the clubs in college paid off. Jessi (Jaanu) was very pleased with how his career turned out.

On reading this, Ram was shocked to know that neither he nor Karthik married Jessi (Jaanu).  Ram wishes to know who her husband was or atleast her real name‚Ä¶ Devastated Ram threw the diary away. In fall, there was a quote from Jaanu on the last page. 

‚ÄúDive into the pixels of memories, and let the journey guide you. Seek out the essence within the clubs on the CEG, where every click unveils a layer of the untold story. Pay attention to the rhythm of memories; there might be a magic number of clicks that holds the key to unraveling the secret love saga of Karthik (Simbu).‚Äù

In the hushed shadows of the parking area, Ram's patience wore thin, and he decided to unravel the mystery by calling Karthik. A conversation ensued, revealing the untold chapters of Jaanu's journey.

It turns out that after the tumultuous family challenges with Karthik, Jaanu, embarked on a new chapter in her academic pursuit, pursuing a Ph.D. within the same college. However, her life took a darker turn upon moving to Chennai, where she found herself entangled with Muthupandi, a notorious gangster determined to marry her.

Muthupandi was convinced that Jaanu was his lost love, believing her name to be "Dhanalakshmi." Then was the hero entry, ‚ÄúAnna yaaru thalapathyyy‚Ä¶‚Äù. She was saved by Velu, a kabaddi player who came to Chennai for a match. Velu saves Dhanalakshmi from the clutches of Muthupandi, hiding her in his room without his family's knowledge. Together with his friends, Velu orchestrates a daring escape, arranging plane tickets for Dhanalakshmi to return to Singapore.

However Dhanalakshmi, moved by Velu's heroism, refuses to leave until the kabaddi match finals, scheduled to take place at none other than the CEG ground. The stakes rise as Velu's lack of focus in the game is replaced by his best performance on seeing Dhanalakshmi in the Main Gallery, winning his team the championship.

At the end Muthupandi, with his henchmen in tow, arrives to settle the score. The question lingers: Did Velu survive the dangerous encounter?

Just like Velu got his power seeing Dhanalakshmi at the Main Gallery, you might get the power to hear his story there.

Velu, against all odds, engaged in a fierce confrontation with Muthupandi, and after a relentless struggle, emerged victorious. The shadows of danger lifted, allowing Velu and Jaanu to find solace in a serene haven.

Now residing in Himachal Pradesh under the identities of Parithi and Sathya, the couple built a peaceful life in Theog. Parithi, known as Velu in his past, embraced a new role as an animal rescuer and the owner of a quaint caf√©. The family, which now included their son Siddharth "Siddhu" and daughter Mathi "Chintu," found joy in the simplicity of their life.

The tranquility of their life is disrupted one night at the caf√© when Shanmugham, a robber, and his gang attempt to loot the establishment. However, when one of the gang members makes a move on his employee Shruthi, Parithi is propelled into a fit of rage. He takes on the gang, defending his family. Sathya wonders how he is able to beat those many gangsters and shocked to see her rageful husband

His photograph circulates in newspapers nationwide. This catches the attention of notorious gangster Harold Das, who, after seeing Parithi's image, recongizing  him.  ‚ÄúBadass maaa‚Ä¶.‚Äù bgm plays in the background üòÇ 


Harold had doubts about the true identity of Parithi. As Harold's curiosity about his true identity grew, a whisper of memories unfolded. He decided to seek the essence where memories dance in a fountain, at the heart of his red heart which stays as strong as a building.
